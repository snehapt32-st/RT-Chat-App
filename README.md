TASK DESCRIPTION

As part of my internship, I developed a Real-Time Chat Application to gain practical experience in building interactive web applications that support live communication. The main objective of this task was to understand how real-time data exchange works and to create a chat system that allows users to send and receive messages instantly in a browser-based environment.This task helped me get knowledge of websockets.

The application was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebSocket technology. HTML was used to structure the chat interface, including the message display area, input field, and send button. CSS was applied to design a clean and responsive user interface, focusing on simplicity, readability, and ease of use. The layout was designed to work smoothly across different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktops and mobile devices.

JavaScript was used to handle the core functionality of the application. It manages user input, sends messages to the server, receives incoming messages, and updates the chat window in real time without requiring a page refresh. WebSockets were used to enable continuous two-way communication between the client and the server, allowing messages to be exchanged instantly. This approach helps reduce latency and creates a smooth, real-time chatting experience.

The chat application allows users to type messages into an input field and send them using a button or keyboard action. Messages are immediately displayed in the chat window for all connected users. The application dynamically updates the interface whenever a new message is received, making communication fast and interactive. Basic validations are included to prevent empty messages and ensure proper message handling.

During the development process, I faced challenges related to handling real-time data flow, managing multiple client connections, and ensuring message synchronization. These challenges were addressed by implementing proper WebSocket event handling and structured JavaScript logic. Through this task, I gained valuable experience in real-time communication, event-driven programming, client-server interaction, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

Overall, the Real-Time Chat Application was a valuable internship task that enhanced my understanding of modern web communication technologies. It provided practical exposure to real-world web development concepts and demonstrated my ability to design and develop a responsive, real-time web application.
